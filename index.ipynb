    "The structure of the data registration process is based on the following three concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Delivery\n",
    "2. Extracted Data\n",
    "3. Transformed Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially it's a take on the traditional __ETL__ process which adds in an extra step call `Receive`. The reason for the additional step is that while in pure IT environments receipt of data is generally a contract managed between two systems and is rolled into the `E: Extract` part of the __ETL__ process. In Data Analytics receipt of data is only sometimes between systems. Often it is between people. We therefore need to create a log of the data receipt somewhere and only after the data is logged can we proceed to extract information from the folder dump or excel extravaganzza we've been delivered. To account for this and to account for the fact that we're working in a team environment we set the process in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. L: `Load`\n",
    "1. R: `Receive`   == 01_Delivery\n",
    "2. E: `Extract`   == 02_RAW\n",
    "3. T: `Transform` == 03_Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice in the process above that the folder structure only accounts for steps 1-3 and doesn't account for step 0. This is normal, step 0 is just putting data into the registration system. We're trying to make it super easy by just using a file system for that. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the sections below we'll go over what each of steps 1-3 are about and what the requirements are for the Data Analyst.\n",
    "\n",
    "__tldr;__  \n",
    "Everything you get goes in `Delivery`, if it's got valuable data extract it to `Raw`, if you want to use extracted data transform it to a `Dataset` from several raw data elements and/or Datasets. Filtering happens during the Dataset creation (`Raw` -> `Dataset`), data conversion happens during extraction (`Delivery` -> `Raw`).\n",

    "A Delivery is data or a group of data delivered at a particular point in time. The data can be preprocessed by the source or can be in a format which needs a more manual extraction. A delivery can also contain 1 or more different types of data to extract. This is because when someone provides us with a data dump it's not always immediately obvious whether we have multiple data elements in the dump. \n",

    "When data flows from Delivery to Raw that means that the Data Analyst has found value in extracting the information from the delivery. A key thing to note is that a Raw data element can only ever have 1 source but a Delivery can have many Raw data elements extracted from it. The Raw data should be converted to a type-specific data storage format but the data should not be filtered or joined with other data. Another part of the Raw data extraction that is important is that during the extraction process the Data Analyst needs to produce a report which future users of the data can use to quickly determine what type of data is contained in the Raw data element.
